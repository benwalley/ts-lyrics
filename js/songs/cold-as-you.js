    album: 'Taylor Swift',
    lyrics:
        `It's junked out joint off a backroad
A blinkin' window sign with an arrow
A gravel Iot chocked full of toolbox trucks
Makin' their happy hour way home
When guys like me lose girls like you
That's where we run to
They got "Whiskey River" on a jukebox
A honky tonk sawdust dance floor
A neon, five o'clock, broke clock
And plenty damn many when you want one more
Of this broke heart fool on an old bar stool
Drinkin' beer almost as cold as you
A bunch of good time numbers on the stall door
A picture of you on a dart board
Them cinder block walls ain't ever been cleaned
Still ain't as dirty as you done me
"Whiskey River" on a jukebox
A honky tonk sawdust dance floor
A neon, five o'clock, broke clock
And plenty damn many when you want one more
Of this broke heart fool on an old bar stool
Drinkin' beer almost as cold as you
When guys like me lose girls like you
That's where we run to
We got "Whiskey River" on a jukebox
A honky tonk sawdust dance floor
A neon, five o'clock, broke clock
And plenty damn many when you want one more
Of this broke heart fool on an old bar stool
Drinkin' beer almost as cold as you
Cold as you`
